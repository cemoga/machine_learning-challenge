## Instructions
<p> To run this code, ensure that all the above libraries are installed in your environment</p>
<b> Important Note:</b>
It is only necessary to run the `app.py` `Python Flask App`.

#### Steps
1. - Run the `Flask` server by running the `app.py` file.
2. - Run the IP address created by the `Flask` server which should look like http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or similar. This renders the index.html file containing the visualizations.
3. - Upload an image of your choosing to run through the ML models. The predictions and accuracies will be displayed on the HTML page.

# Directory Description
1. cnn_model_notebooks
2. pre-trained models notebook
3. pre_trained_models_app

## cnn_model_notebooks
This file contains our teams custom CNN model as well as `Jupyter Notebooks` and other files used to support development of this model.

## pre-trained models notebook
1. `model_predictions.ipynb` is the master notebook that runs all predictions though pre-trained models. This was used to develop and test the code that is in app.py.

## pre_trained_models_app/app.py
This file contains the `Python` code necessary to create a `Flask` development server to deploy the visualizations created using `Javascript` libraries.

## pre_trained_models_app/static
This folder contains all the `Javascript` code used to create the visualizations displayed through the HTML files.
### Contents of Static
1. `CSS` Folder containing CSS for html files.
2. `image` Folder that temporarily stores the user uploaded image.
3. `favicon` Folder that supports rendering of the favicon on HTML page. 
4. `predictions.js` File that includes the formatting for the predictions page.

## pre_trained_models_app/templates
This folder contains all the `HTMl` code used to display all the visualizations generated by using the `Javascript` code and `libraries`.
### Contents of templates
1. `models.html` Page which displays information on the models that were used for the predictions. 
2. `predictions.html` Page which displays original image, prediction details and guage. 
3. `template.html` Page which is the bacis template for all renderings of the HTML. 
4. `upload.html` Page which allows user to upload an image.
