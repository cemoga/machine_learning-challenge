## Instructions
<p> To run this code, ensure that all the above libraries are installed in your environment</p>
<b> Important Note:</b>
It is only necessary to run the `app.py` `Python Flask App`.

#### Steps
1. - Run the `Flask` server by running the `app.py` file.
2. - Run the IP address created by the `Flask` server which should look like http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or similar. This renders the index.html file containing the visualizations.
3. - Upload an image of your choosing to run through the ML models. The predictions and accuracies will be displayed on the HTML page.

# Directory Description
1. CNN Model Notebooks
2. Pre-Trained Models Notebook
3. Pre-Trained Models App

## CNN Model Notebooks
This file contains our team's custom CNN model as well as `Jupyter Notebooks` and other files used to support the development of this model.

## Pre-Trained Models Notebook
1. `model_predictions.ipynb` is the master notebook that runs all predictions through pre-trained models. This was used to develop and test the code that is in app.py.

## pre_trained_models_app/app.py
This file contains the `Python` code necessary to create a `Flask` development server to deploy the visualizations created using `Javascript` libraries.

## pre_trained_models_app/static
This folder contains all the `Javascript` code used to create the visualizations displayed through the `HTMl` files and to load the data from the flask server.

### Contents of Static
1. `CSS` Folder containing CSS for `HTMl` files.
2. `image` Folder that temporarily stores the user uploaded image.
3. `predictions.js` File that includes the formatting for the predictions page.

## pre_trained_models_app/templates
This folder contains all the `HTMl` code used to display all the visualizations generated by using the `Javascript` code and `libraries`.
### Contents of templates
1. `predictions.html` Page which displays the original image, prediction details and gauge. 
2. `upload.html` Page which allows the user to upload an image.
